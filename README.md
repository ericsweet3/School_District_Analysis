## School District Analysis


## Project Overview
- For this project, we initially ran an analysis and report about the school grade percentages of various high schools, charter and public, based on different aspects such as size, budget, etc. We were notified that some grades showed evidence of academic dishonesty, specifically the 9th grade at Thomas High School. We went back in and re-factored the code to reflect the initial report, but without the 9th grade levels.
  
## Results

- How is the district summary affected?
	- Surprisingly not by much, there's the obvious slight change that you'll see when removing an entire grade level, but as for the district summary, you don't see any changes with regards to the holistic view of the district. (see 1a)

- How is the school summary affected? 
	- The school summary is only slightly affected (as expected when removing a large set of data). The percentages fell very slightly along with the overall percentage. (see 1b)

- How does replacing the ninth graders' math and reading scores affect Thomas High School's performance relative to the other schools?
	-  Again, it changed practically nothing. Thomas High School is still one of the top performing schools in the district, even without factoring in the 9th grade scores. From the district summary you can see that their overall % passing grades still places them at 2nd compared to the other schools, and removing the 9th grade scores did nothing to move them from that spot. (see 1c)

- You can also take into account math/reading scores, spending, school size, and the type of school (district or charter) which I will show below.
